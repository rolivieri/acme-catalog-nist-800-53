# si-14.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Non-persistent Connectivity

## Control Statement

Establish connections to the system on demand and terminate connections after {{ insert: param, si-14.03_odp }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-14(03)[01]\] connections to the system are established on demand;

- \[SI-14(03)[02]\] connections to the system are terminated after {{ insert: param, si-14.03_odp }}.

## Control guidance

Persistent connections to systems can provide advanced adversaries with paths to move laterally through systems and potentially position themselves closer to high value assets. Limiting the availability of such connections impedes the adversaryâ€™s ability to move freely through organizational systems.
