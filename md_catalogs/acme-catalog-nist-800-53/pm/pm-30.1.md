## Control guidance

The identification and prioritization of suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and services is paramount to the mission/business success of organizations. The assessment of suppliers is conducted using supplier reviews (see [SR-6](#sr-6) ) and supply chain risk assessment processes (see [RA-3(1)](#ra-3.1) ). An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.
