# pm-5.1 - \[Program Management\] Inventory of Personally Identifiable Information

## Control Statement

Establish, maintain, and update {{ insert: param, pm-05.01_odp }} an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable information.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PM-05(01)[01]\] an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable information is established;

- \[PM-05(01)[02]\] an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable information is maintained;

- \[PM-05(01)[03]\] an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable information is updated {{ insert: param, pm-05.01_odp }}.

## Control guidance

An inventory of systems, applications, and projects that process personally identifiable information supports the mapping of data actions, providing individuals with privacy notices, maintaining accurate personally identifiable information, and limiting the processing of personally identifiable information when such information is not needed for operational purposes. Organizations may use this inventory to ensure that systems only process the personally identifiable information for authorized purposes and that this processing is still relevant and necessary for the purpose specified therein.
