# ma-4.7 - \[Maintenance\] Disconnect Verification

## Control Statement

Verify session and network connection termination after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[MA-04(07)[01]\] session connection termination is verified after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;

- \[MA-04(07)[02]\] network connection termination is verified after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

## Control guidance

Verifying the termination of a connection once maintenance is completed ensures that connections established during nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions have been terminated and are no longer available for use.
