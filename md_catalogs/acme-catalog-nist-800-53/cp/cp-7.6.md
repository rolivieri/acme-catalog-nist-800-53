# cp-7.6 - \[Contingency Planning\] Inability to Return to Primary Site

## Control Statement

Plan and prepare for circumstances that preclude returning to the primary processing site.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CP-07(06)[01]\] circumstances that preclude returning to the primary processing site are planned for;

- \[CP-07(06)[02]\] circumstances that preclude returning to the primary processing site are prepared for.

## Control guidance

There may be situations that preclude an organization from returning to the primary processing site such as if a natural disaster (e.g., flood or a hurricane) damaged or destroyed a facility and it was determined that rebuilding in the same location was not prudent.
