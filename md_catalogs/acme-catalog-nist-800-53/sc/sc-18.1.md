# sc-18.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Identify Unacceptable Code and Take Corrective Actions

## Control Statement

Identify {{ insert: param, sc-18.01_odp.01 }} and take {{ insert: param, sc-18.01_odp.02 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-18(01)[01]\] {{ insert: param, sc-18.01_odp.01 }} is identified;

- \[SC-18(01)[02]\] {{ insert: param, sc-18.01_odp.02 }} are taken if unacceptable mobile code is identified.

## Control guidance

Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes preventing the transmission of word processing files with embedded macros when such macros have been determined to be unacceptable mobile code.
