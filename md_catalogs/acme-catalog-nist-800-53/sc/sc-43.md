# sc-43 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Usage Restrictions

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidelines for the following system components: {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} ; and

- \[b.\] Authorize, monitor, and control the use of such components within the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-43a.\] usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are established for {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }};

- \[SC-43b.\]

  - \[SC-43b.[01]\] the use of {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} is authorized within the system;
  - \[SC-43b.[02]\] the use of {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} is monitored within the system;
  - \[SC-43b.[03]\] the use of {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} is controlled within the system.

## Control guidance

Usage restrictions apply to all system components including but not limited to mobile code, mobile devices, wireless access, and wired and wireless peripheral components (e.g., copiers, printers, scanners, optical devices, and other similar technologies). The usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for system components to cause damage to the system and help to ensure that only authorized system use occurs.
