## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Review {{ insert: param, ac-06.07_odp.01 }} the privileges assigned to {{ insert: param, ac-06.07_odp.02 }} to validate the need for such privileges; and

- \[(b)\] Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-06(07)(a)\] privileges assigned to {{ insert: param, ac-06.07_odp.02 }} are reviewed {{ insert: param, ac-06.07_odp.01 }} to validate the need for such privileges;

- \[AC-06(07)(b)\] privileges are reassigned or removed, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.

## Control guidance

The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.
