# ac-4.24 - \[Access Control\] Internal Normalized Format

## Control Statement

When transferring information between different security domains, parse incoming data into an internal normalized format and regenerate the data to be consistent with its intended specification.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-04(24)[01]\] when transferring information between different security domains, incoming data is parsed into an internal, normalized format;

- \[AC-04(24)[02]\] when transferring information between different security domains, the data is regenerated to be consistent with its intended specification.

## Control guidance

Converting data into normalized forms is one of most of effective mechanisms to stop malicious attacks and large classes of data exfiltration.
